# mercergp
A library for low-rank Mercer Gaussian Processes

This is a PyTorch based library containing classes for representation of special functions and Mercer kernel Gaussian processes for GP regression and other models.

This library depends on wegreenall/ortho, a library for orthogonal polynomial manipulation also based around PyTorch.

This library is for holding code related to my PhD work and is almost always going to be a work in progress. It will act as a dependency for project-specific code
relating to papers/experiments.
